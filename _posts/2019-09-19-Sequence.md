Sequencing is important because without it the computer does not know how to run a certqain chain of commands it requires and order that the programmer has provided. A line of code that i have written is:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("     *     \n    ***    \n   *****   \n  *******  \n  *******  \n  *******  \n  *******  \n  *******  \n ********* \n***********\n    ***    \n     *     \n    * *    \n   ** **   \n");
```

This is my attempt of making a rocket using the console command and the astrix character, i have use \n to create a new line to stack the rocket this can make it easier to write the code.

This line of code was written between:
```csharp
static void Main(){    }
```
